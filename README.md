# CS-370 Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementation

The core purpose of this project is to explore, build, test and analyse the basic concepts and techniques that pertain to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.
Analyze how algorithms are used in artificial intelligence to solve a variety of complex problems.



An intelligent agent was created to solve a Treasure Hunt game by using random paths to discover the solution. As the agent does not know the correct path to take, it would need to perform multiple trials to find the correct path. The agent will get input data for the problem from the start point, target point, and any other possible points that the agent will make. It will then run through the problem multiple times until it finds the optimal path for solving the problem, then it will emulate an output of the shortest optimal path.

## Starter code sources: keras.io and SNHU

## Reinforcement learning algorithm implementation
I created the code that incorporates a reinforcement learning algorithm, and I also wrote the game loops using Keras and Tensorflow to successfully implement the pathfinding solution. The game setup code, which consists of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, was provided to me.
