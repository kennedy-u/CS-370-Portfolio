# CS-370 Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementation

The core purpose of this project is to explore, build, test and analyse the basic concepts and techniques that pertain to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.
Analyze how algorithms are used in artificial intelligence to solve a variety of complex problems.



An intelligent agent was created to solve a Treasure Hunt game by using random paths to discover the solution. As the agent does not know the correct path to take, it would need to perform multiple trials to find the correct path. The agent will get input data for the problem from the start point, target point, and any other possible points that the agent will make. It will then run through the problem multiple times until it finds the optimal path for solving the problem, then it will emulate an output of the shortest optimal path.

## Starter code sources: keras.io and SNHU

## Reinforcement learning algorithm implementation
I created the code that incorporates a reinforcement learning algorithm, and I also wrote the game loops using Keras and Tensorflow to successfully implement the pathfinding solution. The game setup code, which consists of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, was provided to me.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists play a crucial role in problem-solving by developing software that processes data at a faster rate than human manual labor can achieve, making calculations that are more accurate and precise, and creating technology that simplifies people's lives and businesses. The importance of computer scientists and their work is clear since computers have revolutionized the world. Without computer scientists, we wouldn't have advanced 3D graphics films, video games, or even something as simple as quickly adding up the number of employees for various companies throughout states. Projects like this are vital to companies, as they can locate and retrieve information quickly and with minimal effort. For instance, this project helped Grazioso Salvare find the desired dog records with a specific age range and breed, saving them hours of manual research among the 10,000 records. This project is expandable, so it can accommodate any additional records added in the future, making it a one-time effort for Grazioso Salvare.


## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, my problem-solving approach begins by identifying the desired outcome and selecting the necessary tools to achieve it. I prioritize building the foundational tools before proceeding with higher-level functions. This project presented a unique challenge as it was my first time working with databases. To tackle this task, I built the database, created the CRUD module, and used it to construct the interactive dashboard. Previously, I relied on arrays, vectors, and objects to store data, which proved to be inefficient for handling large amounts of data. This project provided an opportunity to expand my skillset and introduced me to valuable techniques, such as the CRUD module. I am already considering how to incorporate it into the SQL database I am building for my website project. Additionally, I recognize the importance of aggregation when working with vast amounts of data and limited search time.


## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
