# _Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning Algorithm_

The core purpose of this project is to explore, build, test and analyse the basic concepts and techniques that pertain to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.
Analyze how algorithms are used in artificial intelligence to solve a variety of complex problems..

An intelligent agent was created to solve a Treasure Hunt game by using random paths to discover the solution. As the agent does not know the correct path to take, it would need to perform multiple trials to find the correct path. The agent will get input data for the problem from the start point, target point, and any other possible points that the agent will make. It will then run through the problem multiple times until it finds the optimal path for solving the problem, then it will emulate an output of the shortest optimal path.

## Starter code sources: Keras.io, TensorFlow.org and snhu.edu

## Reinforcement learning algorithm implementation
I created the code that incorporates a reinforcement learning algorithm, and I also wrote the game loops using Keras and Tensorflow to successfully implement the pathfinding solution. The game setup code, which consists of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, was provided to me.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists study and design algorithms, software systems, and computing technologies to solve a wide range of problems and advance our understanding of computing. Computer scientist's work can involve developing new programming languages, designing hardware systems, creating algorithms to analyze large data sets, and designing user interfaces for software applications, among other tasks.

The work of computer scientists matters because it has the potential to improve many aspects of modern society, from healthcare and education to transportation and communication. By developing new computing technologies and systems, computer scientists can help us tackle complex problems more effectively, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance our ability to communicate and collaborate with one another.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, and designing and implementing solutions using appropriate computing tools and techniques. This can involve developing algorithms to optimize a process, designing user interfaces for a software application, or creating a data model to analyze large data sets, among other approaches.


## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization. This includes ensuring that any software or technology I develop is safe, reliable, and does not harm users or the environment. I should also strive to design systems that are accessible and inclusive, and protect users' privacy and security. It is important to consider the potential impact of my work on society and to take steps to mitigate any negative effects. Additionally, I should follow ethical standards and guidelines set by professional organizations, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to ensure that my work is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner.
